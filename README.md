### instruction for running

1. after cloning down from git hub make sure your node is running the right version (node v19.4.0) and create your own venv, activate it, then run python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt. after everything is installed run  python3 manage.py runserver.

2. back end is running. the back end needs to be running first then run your front end

### approach taken

- we started by making a model with the 2 felids that are the main data we need. then went through and made it meet mvp. we then started to add things to it like user authentication and able to log more thing than just the silt fence stuff.
